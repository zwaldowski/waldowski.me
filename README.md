# waldowski.me (2022)

One-page landing site iterating on my previous attempts at a [microblog](https://github.com/zwaldowski/microdotblog) and [landing page](https://github.com/zwaldowski/waldowski.me).

## Try it yourself

Remix me on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/~clover-small-blouse):

1. Update `src/_data/metadata.json` and `src/_data/links.json` for your own details.
1. Change `index.md` to tell say a little about yourself.
1. Add a new background image asset and update it in the CSS.
1. Change the colors in the CSS.
