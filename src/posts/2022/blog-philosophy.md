Above all, I don't want to be doing this.

OK, not really. But what I actually am is indecisive (in all things!), and I have competing urges, like:

- Wanting to share the few bits of actual knowledge and experience that, like a [salt-craving mountain goat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0jMzdbEui0), I've licked off the world
- Genuine deference to people that are smarter and more well-spoken than me

and:

- An allergy to the self-branding of unimpressive technocrats like myself as raconteurs with "hot takes"
- Dear lord, [someone is wrong on the internet](https://xkcd.com/386/)

and:

- I really, _really_ don't want to manage web publishing myself
- Being filled with rage by the tools that are supposed to make this easy

This site is the latest in a long tradition of these priorities flip-flopping and turning into something new.
I don't intend to say much, because I don't have much to say.

I owe a debt of gratitude to [Kyle](https://kylehugh.es) for stealing much of his approach [after a chance conversation on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@kyle@mister.computer/109599250472700900).
I like the idea of having a space on the internet whose goal is to **conciously** remove expectations and barriers of self-confidence in order to be more authentic, even mindful.
We'll see if it sticks.

## The Twitter Era

Important stuff happened to me on Twitter. I found myself. I landed a job. I came out. I found the deepest, truest love I've ever had. So it's not like I can forget it. I can't defend it, either.

I was an early adopter, but I was a teenager at the time so it actually became horribly embedded into my psyche for over a decade. A number of people are recognizing the negative impact this has had on them (circa 2023). But I was there already. It killed my mood all the time, and made me worse at communicating thoughtfully. There's dozens more reasons — many on a global scale — but those should be enough for wanting something out of your life.

## Finding a Home

If you're someone with a little technical ability, it's _en vogue_ to hyperobsess over your blog as one of a million eternally-unfinished side projects.
(I'm not bitter.)
I chafe at this for a couple of reasons, the biggest one being the way it leads me down an infinite road of bikeshedding.

I just want to have something _nice_, to free myself up to do the things I actually like to do, that matches my values, and that I can throw money at to solve the hard problems.
In practice, ticking all those boxes is an exercise in frustration.

- The popular website-in-a-box-tools are largely expressive enough, but their pricing economies suck. I am lucky enough to afford it, but throwing that money in the toilet month after month creates an unhealthy association between guilt and writing/sharing/self-promotion.
- I'm aware and excited of the growing tooling on the fediverse, I simply don't want to be a sysadmin. If I can sign in to a thing and update Debian packages, I _will_ do it compulsively.
- Micro.blog did such a good job of abstraction, but that community showed its ass being really petty and insular. Like deciding to take middling native apps and make them worse hybrid apps as a way to "get back" at app stores. I don't actually care that much about the perceived evil of walled gardens, and it simply doesn't make sense to pay into a walled garden I don't like the smell of.

- I'm keeping an eye on [weblog.lol](https://weblog.lol) just because it's so damn cute.

For now, my home is spread between here (for more permanent things) and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@zw) (for more ephemeral things).
