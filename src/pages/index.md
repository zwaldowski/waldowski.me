Howdy!

I’m a passionate, perfectionist, sometimes angry developer with a decade of experience bringing uncompromising excellence to mobile platforms.
As a technical leader, I advise and elevate team members at all levels, promote internationalization and accessibility, and focus on quality deliverables. I am remembered for “seriously scary” recall of years-past details, pitfalls, and fixes.

I have worked with really obscure clients that [nobody knows](https://www.apple.com) about.
Occasionally, I break software [in public](https://github.com/zwaldowski) rather than in private.

Find me lurking on all your favorite websites.
