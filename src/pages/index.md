Hi there! Iâ€™m a passionate, perfectionist, angry app developer at [Big Nerd Ranch](https://www.bignerdranch.com) living in Atlanta, GA, USA with my awesome partner and our 6 shiba inu plushies.
I make native iOS apps for really obscure clients that [nobody knows](https://www.apple.com) about.
Occasionally, I break software [in public](https://github.com/zwaldowski) rather than in private.
Find me lurking on all your favorite websites.
