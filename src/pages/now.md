### <span role="img">üë®üèª‚Äçüíª</span> Lived

Journal app is [coming to iPad and Mac](https://www.apple.com/os/macos/)! I remain stoked to work on something everyday that helps people get to know themselves better.

My awesome partner and I continue to live in Vista, CA, USA where we distract our [gray tabby Bucky](/assets/uploads/2024/bucky.jpg) with an endless stream of felt stuffed mice.
