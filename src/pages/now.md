### <span role="img">👨🏻‍💻</span> Lived

I've started my second year working on the [Journal app](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-18/) for iPhone. I remain grateful for this opportunity to help people take stock of themselves and get to know themselves better — and that includes myself!

 My awesome partner and I just bought a house in Vista, CA, USA where we occupy our [gray tabby Bucky](/assets/uploads/2024/bucky.jpg) with an endless stream of felt mice.
