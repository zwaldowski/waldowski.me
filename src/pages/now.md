### <span role="img">👨🏻‍💻</span> Lived

Settling into my new job working on the [Journal app](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-17/) for iPhone. My awesome partner and I moved to San Diego, CA, USA for this role. I'm overwhelmed by this opportunity to help people get to know themselves better — including myself!
