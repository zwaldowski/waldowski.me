# I do the best imitation of myself

(It's from a [song](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/best-imitation-of-myself/771779576?i=771779689).)

I'm a passionate, perfectionist, angry app developer at [Big Nerd Ranch](https://www.bignerdranch.com) living in Atlanta, GA, USA with my awesome partner and our 6 shiba inu plushies.

I make native iOS apps for really obscure clients that [nobody knows](https://www.apple.com) about.
Occasionally, I break software [in public](https://github.com/zwaldowski) rather than in private.

I've discovered something of an allergy to social media, so this page is what you get in lieu of any tweets, toots, takes, statuses, or pivots to short-form video.

## Find me lurking on:
