# I do the best imitation of myself

(It's from a [song](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/best-imitation-of-myself/771779576?i=771779689).)

I'm a passionate, perfectionist, angry app developer at [Big Nerd Ranch](https://www.bignerdranch.com) living in Atlanta, GA, USA with my awesome partner and our 6 shiba inu plushies.

I make native iOS apps for really obscure clients that [nobody knows](https://www.apple.com) about.
Occasionally, I break software [in public](https://github.com/zwaldowski) rather than in private.

I've discovered something of an aversion to social media, so this page is what you get instead of tweets, toots, posts, takes, or pivots to short-form video. Find me lurking elsewhere.
